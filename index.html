        <article>Frogs are amphibians that have a long and complex evolutionary history that dates back over 200 million years. The earliest known frog fossils come from the Early Jurassic period, and they were very similar to modern frogs in terms of their skeletal structure.

          Over time, frogs have evolved to occupy a wide variety of habitats, from tropical rainforests to deserts, and from freshwater ponds to brackish marshes. They are found on every continent except Antarctica, and there are more than 7,000 species of frogs in the world today.
          
          Frogs are thought to have evolved from a group of fish called the lobe-finned fish, which had a fleshy limb-like appendage that allowed them to crawl along the bottom of shallow water. Over time, these appendages evolved into the legs and feet that modern frogs use to jump and swim.
          
          One of the most distinctive features of frogs is their ability to breathe through their skin, which allows them to absorb oxygen from the air and water. This adaptation is thought to have helped frogs survive in a variety of aquatic and terrestrial environments.
          
          Frogs also have a unique reproductive strategy, in which they lay their eggs in water and the tadpoles that hatch from the eggs undergo a metamorphosis into adult frogs. This strategy has allowed frogs to colonize a wide range of habitats, as long as there is a source of water for their eggs to develop.</article></div>
