                    The Cascades frog, also known as the Cascades Mountain frog,
                    is a small species of frog found in the Pacific Northwest
                    region of North America, particularly in the Cascade Range
                    of Washington and Oregon. They are typically brown or green
                    in color, with dark spots on their back, and have a
                    distinctive dark stripe that runs through their eye and down
                    their snout. These frogs are semi-aquatic, spending much of
                    their time in or near shallow streams and ponds, where they
                    feed on insects and other small invertebrates.
                    Unfortunately, like many amphibian species, Cascades frogs
                    are facing threats from habitat loss, climate change, and
                    disease, making conservation efforts all the more important.

                          tree frog, a small arboreal frog found throughout much
                          of Europe and parts of Asia. They are typically bright
                          green in color with a white or yellow stripe running
                          down their sides and a dark stripe through their eye.
                          These frogs are nocturnal and spend much of their time
                          in trees, shrubs, and other vegetation near bodies of
                          water. They have a distinctive high-pitched call that
                          can be heard during the breeding season, which
                          typically occurs from May to August. Despite being
                          common in some areas, European tree frogs face threats
                          from habitat loss and fragmentation, pollution, and
                          climate change. Conservation efforts, such as
                          preserving and restoring wetland habitats, are
                          essential for their survival.

                          forests of West and Central Africa. They are typically
                          brown or gray in color with a series of dark spots and
                          stripes on their back and legs. These frogs are
                          primarily terrestrial, spending much of their time on
                          the forest floor where they feed on small
                          invertebrates. They are known for their unique
                          reproductive behavior, which involves the female
                          laying her eggs on the forest floor and the male
                          guarding them until they hatch. Unfortunately, like

                  <p class="card-text">
                    Leopard frog, is a species of frog found in North America,
                    from southern Canada to northern Mexico. They are named for
                    their striking leopard-like spots and can range in color
                    from green to brown. These frogs are semi-aquatic, spending
                    much of their time in or near bodies of water, where they
                    feed on insects, small fish, and other prey. Leopard frogs
                    are also known for their ability to jump great distances,
                    using their powerful hind legs to propel themselves up to 3
                    feet in a single leap. While once common, Leopard frogs are
                    facing threats from habitat loss, pollution, and climate
                    change. Conservation efforts, such as restoring and
                    protecting wetlands and other critical habitats, are
                    important for their survival.
